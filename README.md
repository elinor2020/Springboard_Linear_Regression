# Springboard_Linear_Regression: 
For this notebook, we're going to use the red wine dataset, wineQualityReds.csv. This is a very common dataset for practicing regression analysis and is actually freely available on Kaggle. This project will have the following structure: 1. Sourcing and loading: Import relevant libraries, Load the data, Exploring the data, Choosing a dependent variable. 2. Cleaning, transforming, and visualizing: Visualizing correlations. 3. Modeling: Train/Test split, Making a Linear regression model: your first model, Making a Linear regression model: your second model: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Making a Linear regression model: third model: multiple linear regression, Making a Linear regression model: your fourth model: avoiding redundancy. 4. Evaluating and concluding: Reflection, Which model was best?, Other regression algorithms.
